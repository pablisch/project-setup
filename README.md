# PROJECT SETUP REPOSITORY

The purpose of this repository is to provide shortcuts to setting up a variety of new projects.
It is not an app in itself and cannot be run, but it does contain instructions for setting up new projects.

As the Makers Software Development course progressed I was finding myself repeating the same steps to set up new projects. I decided to create a repository to store the steps I was repeating and to provide a shortcut to setting up new projects. This started with simple Ruby projects and has grown to include more complex projects using React, Express and MongoDB.
